What is the expected number of distinct colors in 20 randomly picked balls?

Give your answer with nine digits after the decimal point (a.bcdefghij).

a.bcdefghij
5.525443786

161884603662657876 possible choices of balls...


X = colors drawn 
Y = colors not drawn = 7-X = y1 + y2 + .. y7




E(Yi) = P(i-th color not drawn) = 60c20 / 70c20
